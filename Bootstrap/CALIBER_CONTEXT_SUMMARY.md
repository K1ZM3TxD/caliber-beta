# CALIBER_CONTEXT_SUMMARY

## Project Status / Current active work


- Calibration UI now starts with a single landing page and stable header.
- Resume upload -> 5 prompts -> Processing -> Title + Job Paste (combined) -> Processing -> Fit score + summary
- After job description, the Fit score (0–10) + summary page appears.
- LLM dialogue mode will open after score+summary (next phase toggle).

## Current Blocker


No current blockers on locked calibration flow. Awaiting LLM dialogue phase toggle implementation.

## Next Tasks (in order)

1. Finalize Fit score + summary page after job description input.
2. Implement LLM dialogue mode toggle after score+summary.
