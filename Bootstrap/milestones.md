# Caliber — MILESTONES (Revised After Atomic Execution Shift)

This document defines the active build runway.

It changes only when scope shifts or architectural decisions are made.

This file is the single source of truth for current system intent.

# OPERATIONAL BASELINE (LOCKED)

## Core Architecture

- Deterministic state machine (event-driven, no auto-chaining)
- Externally visible states only
- JSON-only API responses
- No hidden transitions
- Strict ADVANCE allowlist
- Resume upload is file-only
- No paste path

---

# Pattern Synthesis Architecture (LOCKED)

## Structural Backbone

Pattern Synthesis must follow the 4-layer cadence structure:

1. Identity Contrast  
2. Intervention Contrast  
3. Construction Layer  
4. Conditional Consequence Drop (earned only)

No motivational tone.  
No abstraction drift.  
No KPI framing.  
Cadence structure invariant.

---

# ACTIVE MILESTONE

## Milestone 5.1 — Hybrid Semantic Synthesis (ACTIVE)

### Objective

Deliver “eerily specific” Pattern Synthesis using:

Locked 4-layer backbone  
+  
LLM semantic fill derived from:
- Resume text
- Prompt answers
- Person vector

Deterministic scoring remains unchanged.

---

# 5.1 EXECUTION STRUCTURE (ATOMIC SEQUENCING)

Milestone 5.1 is now executed through strictly atomic tasks.

No multi-layer implementation allowed.

Each subsection below represents an independent execution unit.

Progress only advances after validation of each unit.

---

## 5.1A — Locked Calibration Prompts (COMPLETED / LOCKED)

Prompts 1–5 are instrumentation and must remain deterministic.

Final Locked Wording:

1. In your most recent role, what part of the work felt most like you?  
2. What part of the role drained you fastest?  
3. What do others come to you for that isn’t necessarily in your job description?  
4. What type of challenge feels exciting rather than overwhelming?  
5. If you removed job titles entirely, how would you describe the work you’re best at?

Rules:
- No AI rewriting
- No structural reframing
- No additional qualifiers
- Canonical source only
- Mechanical drift prevention enforced

Status: LOCKED

## 5.1B — LLM Wiring (PENDING)

Scope:
- Replace deterministic synthesis path with LLM generation.
- No validation changes.
- No retry logic yet.
- No UI changes.
- Deterministic fallback preserved.

This step is wiring only.

---

## 5.1C — Deterministic Validation Layer (PENDING)

Scope:
- Enforce strict JSON schema.
- Enforce no repeated content words (>=5 chars).
- Enforce construction layer verb pattern.
- Enforce consequence length <= 7 words.
- Enforce blacklist of abstraction phrases.
- Reject non-compliant output.

No retry logic yet.
Fallback remains intact.

---

## 5.1D — Single Retry Enforcement (PENDING)

Scope:
- If validation fails:
  - Retry once with validation errors included.
- If retry fails:
  - Trigger deterministic fallback.
- No UI changes.

---

## 5.1E — Lexical Grounding Refinement (PENDING)

Scope:
- Reuse lexical anchors from resume and prompt answers.
- Reduce over-constraint causing generic phrasing.
- Allow “system” where not structurally harmful.
- Maintain:
  - No praise
  - No repetition
  - No motivational tone
  - No metric blending

---

# 5.2 — Synthesis Experience Refinement (PENDING)

UI-only changes.

- Single column centered layout
- Controlled vertical rhythm
- Bullet block centered under headers
- Bullet reframing:
  - “Pattern Expresses Cleanly When”
  - “Pattern Friction Emerges When”
- Continue button de-emphasis
- Remove visual density

No scoring changes.

---

# 5.3 — Bullet Semantic Enrichment (PLANNED)

Decision locked: Enriched via single-pass segmented LLM.

Constraints:
- Dimension selection remains deterministic.
- Bullet structure remains fixed.
- Vocabulary band constraint ±15%.
- No praise.
- No identity labeling.
- No skill blending.
- Deterministic validation required.
- Deterministic fallback retained.

Execution will follow atomic sequencing once 5.1 is complete.

---

# Deterministic Fallback Doctrine (LOCKED)

Fallback synthesis exists solely as structural guard.

It:
- Preserves 4-layer structure
- Prevents downstream crashes
- Is not primary experience

Fallback should rarely be shown.

---

# Definition of Done — 5.1

Create Session  
→ Resume Upload  
→ Prompts 1–5 (locked wording)  
→ Consolidation Ritual  
→ Encoding Ritual  
→ Pattern Synthesis (LLM semantic fill, structurally locked, validated)  
→ Title Hypothesis  
→ Job Ingest  
→ Alignment Output  

Additionally:

- Prompts remain stable across sessions.
- LLM output passes validation deterministically.
- Retry logic enforced.
- Deterministic fallback preserved.
- No abstraction drift.
- No repetition loops.
- No metric blending.
