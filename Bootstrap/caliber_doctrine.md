(Anchor-First Architecture Version)



Caliber Doctrine



This document defines the non-negotiable philosophical and structural foundation of Caliber.



If this document changes, the product has changed.



Execution mechanics live in KERNEL.md.

Task sequencing lives in MILESTONES.md.



I. Philosophical Thesis



Caliber compresses demonstrated behavior into structural pattern.



Caliber does not invent identity.

Caliber does not infer personality.

Caliber does not generate narrative meaning.



Caliber extracts and compresses repeated mechanics.



Precision creates clarity.

Clarity creates recognition.

Recognition creates momentum.



Caliber reveals:



How a person stabilizes work



How they intervene when structure fails



How they construct constraints



Where they naturally impose order



What they rebuild when incentives distort clarity



Caliber describes structure — not traits.



The goal is recognition, not affirmation.

The output must feel exposed, not praised.



II. Anchor-Grounded Synthesis



Caliber operates under Anchor-First Architecture.



All synthesis must be lexically grounded in user-provided signal.



This means:



Repeated verbs carry highest weight.



Repeated operational nouns carry high weight.



Identity language carries low weight.



Emotional framing carries minimal weight.



Resume headline language is not privileged.



Synthesis must reuse high-frequency mechanical anchors.



Novel archetype language is considered drift.



Abstraction without lexical grounding is invalid.



The LLM is not an author.

It is a constrained compressor operating under anchor bias.



If output cannot be traced to visible input signal, it fails.

Signal Hierarchy Clarification

Not all repetition carries equal structural weight.

Repetition under breakdown, constraint construction, or incentive distortion carries higher weight than repetition under incentive-shaped contexts.

Resume repetition alone does not establish structural signal.

Signal must demonstrate cross-context stability, especially under breakdown conditions.

Structural fit prioritizes signal alignment over skill repetition.



III. What Caliber Refuses To Be



Caliber must not:



Produce praise-driven narratives



Generate inspirational framing



Use archetypal personality labels



Inflate emotional identity



Drift into corporate filler language



Abstract beyond lexical anchors



Rephrase marketing copy into softer marketing copy



Caliber is not coaching.

Caliber is not branding.

Caliber is not confidence reinforcement.



If it sounds flattering, it is likely wrong.



IV. Structural Cadence



Pattern Synthesis follows a strict backbone:



Identity Contrast



Intervention Contrast



Construction Layer



Conditional Consequence Drop (earned only)



This structure is product identity.



Naturalness must emerge from specificity, not loosened structure.



Loosening cadence does not improve quality.

Grounding improves quality.



V. Enforcement Model



Philosophy is enforced in code, not implied in prompts.



The system must:



Extract lexical anchors before synthesis



Enforce anchor reuse after synthesis



Penalize invention



Penalize praise framing



Retry once if anchor overlap fails



Fall back deterministically if constraints fail



Constraint-centered architecture overrides prompt-centered philosophy.



VI. Domain Separation Doctrine



The following domains remain strictly independent:



alignment



skillMatch



stretchLoad



No recomputation.

No reframing.

No blending across engines.



Each engine speaks only for itself.



VII. Fallback Philosophy



Deterministic fallback exists solely to preserve structural integrity.



Fallback:



Preserves cadence



Preserves doctrine compliance



Prevents abstraction drift



Is not a creative alternative



If fallback becomes common, extraction logic is failing.



VIII. Quality Standard



A synthesis is valid only if:



It reflects repeated lexical anchors.



It avoids motivational tone.



It avoids praise.



It avoids repetition loops.



It avoids abstraction drift.



It feels mechanically specific.



It exposes structure, not personality.



If it sounds generic, it is wrong.

If it sounds flattering, it is wrong.

If it cannot be traced to anchors, it is wrong.



Technical validity is insufficient.

Philosophical compliance is required.



IX. Change Threshold



This document changes only if:



Caliber shifts from anchor-grounded structural compression to personality modeling.



The cadence backbone is altered.



The enforcement model changes from constraint-first to prompt-first.



The definition of structural specificity changes.



All other adjustments belong in execution layers.
