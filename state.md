\# Caliber — STATE



This document reflects current operational position.



It changes frequently.



---



\## ACTIVE MILESTONE



Milestone 2.3 — Pattern Synthesis Output Logic



---



\## ACTIVE TASK



Add deterministic runtime validation for Pattern Synthesis formatting constraints, and wire it into generatePatternSynthesis().



---



\## LAST 4 LOCKED DECISIONS



Pattern Synthesis mock output must comply with formatting constraints (3 sentences; 4 bullets each; ≤ 8 words per bullet; structural language).



Execution model: reserve Copilot Agent for structural or multi-file work; use direct deterministic rewrites for small scoped tasks.



Auto-merge is enabled for PR workflows when used.



Milestones move to COMPLETE only after explicit user confirmation.



---



\## OPEN QUESTIONS (WITHIN MILESTONE)



Whether sentence counting should treat abbreviations as terminators (v1: simple terminator count).



Whether mirrored opposition should be mechanically derived or statically mocked (v1: mock content + validation only).



---



\## REJECTED DIRECTIONS (DO NOT REOPEN)



Blending Alignment and Skill Match



Introducing additional alignment dimensions



Optimistic inference in role encoding



Emotional misalignment framing



---



\## NEXT CANDIDATE TASK



After validation is in place: confirm Milestone 2.3 completeness criteria and decide whether to mark 2.3 COMPLETE or refine synthesis constraints further.
