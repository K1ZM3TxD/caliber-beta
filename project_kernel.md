Caliber — PROJECT KERNEL (Revised)



This document defines the invariant structure of Caliber.

All doctrine here is considered locked unless explicitly revised.



This kernel governs structural behavior, scoring mechanics, and execution authority.



I. PHILOSOPHY



Calibration optimizes for alignment, not activity.



Competence is not the same as expression.

A role can be executable and still be misaligned.



The system does not decide.

It illuminates.



Precision creates clarity.

Clarity creates momentum.



Calibration is structural grounding — not ego reinforcement.

Filtration is focus.



II. EXECUTION DOCTRINE



Default mode: autonomous execution.



The system proceeds step-by-step without asking for permission.



A question is surfaced only when:



A structural fork materially changes outcome direction



Doctrine does not resolve the tradeoff



User preference meaningfully affects architecture



If escalation is required:



Present one recommended path



Present one viable alternative



Default to recommended path if no response



No artificial branching.

No cosmetic options.

No ritualized confirmation.



Momentum is preserved unless a true structural decision exists.



III. CORE METRICS

ALIGNMENT SCORE (0–10)



Measures working pattern expression fit.



Built from 6 locked structural dimensions.



Severe contradiction penalized more than mild tension



Reflects identity expression — not readiness



Includes structural environment preference



SKILL MATCH (0–10)



Measures execution readiness today.



Built from:



Grounded terrain



Adjacent terrain



New terrain



Encodes authority tier and scope stretch.



Stretch Load = inverse of Skill Match.



METRICS ARE NEVER BLENDED



Alignment measures identity expression.

Skill Match measures capability readiness.



Alignment must never incorporate capability strength.

Skill Match must never incorporate identity alignment.



This separation is structural and invariant.



IV. PATTERN CAPTURE INSTRUMENT (LOCKED)



Calibration extracts working pattern through structured reflection.



Prompts are delivered sequentially, one at a time:



In your most recent role, what part of the work felt most like you?



What part of the role drained you fastest?



What do others come to you for that isn’t necessarily in your job description?



What type of challenge feels exciting rather than overwhelming?



If you removed job titles entirely, how would you describe the work you’re best at?



Rules



Free text only



One question at a time



Hard gating with minimum signal threshold



One clarifier maximum per prompt



Direct confrontation clarifier for evasive responses



Answers frozen once advanced



No instructional framing



Unlimited response length



Reflective answers carry highest language weight



After Prompt 5:



Internal consolidation phase required



Person vector encoded and locked before synthesis



Time-simulated calibration ritual shown with visible progress bar



No synthesis before encoding.



V. ALIGNMENT SCORING MECHANICS (LOCKED)



Assume:



n = 6 dimensions

Person vector P\_i ∈ {0,1,2}

Role vector R\_i ∈ {0,1,2}



Distance per dimension:

d\_i = abs(P\_i - R\_i)



Contradiction classes:



Severe contradiction iff d\_i = 2

Mild tension iff d\_i = 1



Counts:



S = count(d\_i = 2)

M = count(d\_i = 1)



Penalty weighting:



W = 1.0S + 0.35M



Scale to 0–10:



raw = 10 \* (1 - W / n)

Alignment = round(clamp(raw, 0, 10), 1)



Dimensions equally weighted.

Functional form locked.



VI. LOCKED ALIGNMENT DIMENSIONS



Structural Maturity



Authority Scope



Revenue Orientation



Role Ambiguity



Breadth vs Depth



Stakeholder Density



No additional alignment dimensions may be introduced.



VII. POST-CALIBRATION FLOW ARCHITECTURE (LOCKED)



Order may not be skipped.



1\. Resume Ingest



Parse resume for structural signals (not tone).



2\. Reflective Prompts (5)



Extract identity-level pattern signals.



3\. Pattern Synthesis



Output:



2–3 sentence structural summary



Where You Operate Best



Where You Lose Energy (structural translation only)



4\. Title Hypothesis



Output:



Identity summary (1 sentence)



Single market-native title



Plain explanation of role meaning



Open-ended reaction prompt



5\. Title Dialogue Loop



Clarify resistance



Adjust one dimension at a time



Recompute pattern only if new structural signals emerge



No cap on exploration



6\. Job Ingestion



Encode job into locked 6-dimension role vector.



7\. Alignment Output



Show:



Alignment score



Skill Match score



Stretch load



Structural explanation



Severe contradiction surfaced if present



No blending.

No skipping order.



VIII. LANGUAGE DOCTRINE



System must not sound more educated than the user.

May tighten expression within ±15%.



Clarity over ornamentation.



IX. MISALIGNMENT FRAMING



Use:



Adaptation load



Energy diversion



Structural friction



Avoid:



Emotional dramatization



Motivational tone



Therapeutic framing



Misalignment is structural, not personal.
